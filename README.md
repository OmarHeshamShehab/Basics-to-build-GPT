## 🧠 Objective

Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using supervised learning techniques. The dataset includes features like age, sex, class, and more, which are used to build a predictive model.

---

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values using `SimpleImputer`
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **EDA**
   - Visualization of survival rates by gender, class, etc.
   - Correlation heatmaps

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracting titles from names
   - Creating family size features
   - Binning age and fare

4. **Modeling**
   - Train/test split
   - Model selection and tuning
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
   - Cross-validation

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix

6. **Prediction**
   - Final submission file for Kaggle
